    "solutionOne": "Remember it takes several weeks to adjust to the new sleep schedule. A little short-term discomfort now is a small price to pay for long-term satisfaction.  Reaffirm the proven benefits of this procedure.  Also point out the irony of having to fight sleepiness before going to bed.",
    "solutionTwo": "Brainstorm with the group for ideas to stay awake.  Ask other clients what they do late at night to stay awake.  Turn it into a group problem-solving exercise.  Make a list of activities to stay awake.",
    "solutionThree": "Reaffirm the importance of avoiding napping during the day.  This will disrupt the sleep rhythm you are trying to develop with the procedure and destroy any of its benefits.  Ask clients to engage in another activity incompatible with napping when the get to urge to sleep during the day.  This should be an out-of-home activity.",
    "solutionFour": "The body knows how to catch up on the good sleep (i.e., deep sleep).  After a period of partial or total sleep deprivation, the body reacts by spending more time in deep sleep.  Remind client that this happens automatically (don't need to do anything--it is a natural reaction to sleep loss).",
    "solutionFive": "Clients should be asked think about the association between their bed and not-sleeping that is being created by this behaviour.  Lying in bed while awake reinforces the role of their bed as a stimulus for wakefulness.  By using sleep restriction, you are breaking this association, and strengthening the role of your bed as the place to sleep.",
    "solutionSix": "Encourage self-exploration and reframe procedure as a \"behavioural experiment.\"  Work collaboratively with client to test the validity of their assumptions.  Derive a hypothesis, stated in specific operational terms, to test empirically via a behaviour change.",
