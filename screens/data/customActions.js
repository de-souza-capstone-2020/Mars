When you start feeling like you may need a nap it can be helpful to find alternative activities that get you out of your house.  This strategy uses the technique of stimulus control and keeps you from giving into the temptation of retreating to your bed or couch.",

This will help to re-associate your bed with feeling sleepy rather than frustrated. Your bed should be reserved for sleep and sex.",
